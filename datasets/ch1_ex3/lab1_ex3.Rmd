R has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the number of girls baptized per year with the command

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
library(ggplot2)
data(arbuthnot)
```

```{r plot-girls-vs-year}
# use the plot created in this block to answer Question 3, and Knit
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = girls)) +
  geom_point()
```

Before we review the code for this plot, let's summarize the trends we see in the data.

3. Which of the following best describes the number of girls baptised over the years included in this dataset? <strong>Answer Question 3 to the left.</strong>


Back to the code... We use the `ggplot()` function to build plots. If you run the plotting code in your console, you should see the plot appear under the *Plots* tab of the lower right panel of RStudio. Notice that the command above again looks like a function, this time with arguments separated by commas. 

- The first argument is always the dataset. 
- Next, we provide thevariables from the dataset to be assigned to `aes`thetic elements of the plot, e.g. the x and the y axes. 
- Finally, we use another layer, separated by a `+` to specify the `geom`etric object for the plot. Since we want to scatterplot, we use `geom_point`.

You might wonder how you are supposed to know the syntax for the `ggplot` function.  Thankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you're interested in. Try the following in your console:

```{r plot-help, tidy = FALSE}
?ggplot
```

Notice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel. 

<div id="boxedtext">
More extensive help for plotting with the `ggplot2` package can be found at http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/. The best (and easiest) way to learn the syntax is to take a look at the sample plots provided on that page, and modify the code bit by bit until you get achieve the plot you want.

### R as a big calculator

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms. To compute this, we could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in mathematical expressions like

```{r calc-total-bapt-numbers}
5218 + 4683
```

to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this once for each year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys to that of girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```

What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we aren’t looking at a
data frame here), each one representing the sum we’re after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right.

### Adding a new variable to the data frame

We'll be using this new vector to generate some plots, so we'll want to save it as a permanent column in our data frame.

```{r calc-total-bapt-vars-save}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(total = boys + girls)
```

What in the world is going on here? The `%>%` operator is called the **piping** operator.
Basically, it takes the output of the current line and pipes it into the following line of code.

<div id="boxedtext">
**A note on piping: ** Note that we can read these three lines of code as the following: 

*"Take the `arbuthnot` dataset and **pipe** it into the `mutate` function. Using this mutate a new variable called `total` that is the sum of the variables called `boys` and `girls`. Then assign this new resulting dataset to the object called `arbuthnot`, i.e. overwrite the old `arbuthnot` dataset with the new one containing the new variable."*

This is essentially equivalent to going through each row and adding up the boys  
and girls counts for that year and recording that value in a new column called total.
</div>

<div id="boxedtext">
**Where is the new variable? ** When you make changes to variables in your dataset,  click on the name of the dataset again to update it in the data viewer.
</div>

You'll see that there is now a new column called `total` that has been tacked on to the data frame. The special symbol `<-` performs an *assignment*, taking the  output of one line of code and saving it into an object in your workspace. In this case, you already have an object called `arbuthnot`, so this command updates that data set with the new mutated column.

We can make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the following command.

```{r plot-total-vs-year-line}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_line()
```

Note that using `geom_line()` instead of `geom_point()` results in a line plot instead of a scatter plot. You want both? Just layer them on:

```{r plot-total-vs-year-line-and-point}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = total)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: Now, generate a plot of the proportion of boys born over time. What do you see? 
</div>

```{r plot-proportion-of-boys-over-time}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit

```

Finally, in addition to simple mathematical operators like subtraction and division, you can ask R to make comparisons like greater than, `>`, less than, `<`, and equality, `==`. For example, we can ask if boys outnumber girls in each year with the expression

```{r boys-more-than-girls}
arbuthnot <- arbuthnot %>%
  mutate(more_boys = boys > girls)
```

This command add a new variable to the `arbuthnot` data frame containing the values of either `TRUE` if that year had more boys than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not (the answer may surprise you). This variable contains different kind of data than we have considered so far. All other columns in the `arbuthnot` data frame have values are numerical (the year, the number of boys and girls). Here, we've asked R to create *logical* data, data where the values are either `TRUE`or `FALSE`. In general, data analysis will involve many different kinds of data types, and one reason for using R is that it is able to represent and compute with many of them.
