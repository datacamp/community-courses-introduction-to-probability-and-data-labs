6. Create a new variable called `more_boys` which contains the value of either `TRUE` if that year had more boys than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not. Based on this  variable which of the following statements is true? <strong>Answer Question 6 to the left.</strong>

The code that created the `more_boys` column for the `arbuthnot` dataset used the following functions and operators: `%>%`, `mutate()`, `>`.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
library(ggplot2)
data(present)
```


```{r more-boys-per-year}
# type your code for Question 6 here, use the output from this line to answer Question 6, and Knit

```
