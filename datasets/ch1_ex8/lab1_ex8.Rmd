8. In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? <strong>Answer Question 8 to the left.</strong>

*Hint:* Sort your dataset in descending order based on the `total` column. You can do this interactively in the data viewer by clicking on the arrows next to the variable names. Or to arrange the data in a descending order with new function: `desc` (for  descending order).

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(dplyr)
library(statsr)
library(ggplot2)

```


```{r most-total-births}
# type your code for Question 8 here use the output from this line to answer Question 8
# sample code is provided below, edit as necessary, uncomment, and then Knit
#present %>%
#  mutate(total = ?) %>%
#  arrange(desc(total))
```

## Resources for learning R and working in RStudio

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses. You might find the following tips and resources helpful.

- In this course we will be using the `dplyr` (for data wrangling) and `ggplot2` (for data visualization) extensively. If you are googling for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead of googling "scatterplot in R", google "scatterplot in R with ggplot2".

- The following cheatsheets may come in handy throughout the course. Note that some of the code on these cheatsheets may be too advanced for this course, however the majority of it will become useful as you progress through the course material.
    - [Data wrangling cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-rangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
    - [Data visualization cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
    - [R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

- While you will get plenty of exercise working with these packages in the labs of this course, if you would like further opportunities to practice we recommend checking out the relevant courses at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses).
