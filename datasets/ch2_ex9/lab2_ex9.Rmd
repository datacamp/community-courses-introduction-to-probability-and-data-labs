9.  Make a scatterplot of `avg_speed` vs. `distance`. Which of the following is true 
about the relationship between average speed and distance. 
<strong>Answer Question 9 to the left.</strong>

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

nycflights <- nycflights %>%
  mutate(avg_speed = distance / (air_time/60))

```


```{r avg-speed-dist-scatter}
# type your code for Question 9 here, and Knit

```
