Again, in Game 1 Kobe had the following sequence of hits and misses from 
his nine shot attempts in the first quarter:

\[ \textrm{H M | M | H H M | M | M | M} \]

You can verify this by viewing the first 8 rows of the data in the data viewer.

Within the nine shot attempts, there are six streaks, which are separated by a 
"|" above. Their lengths are one, zero, two, zero, zero, zero (in order of 
occurrence).

2.  Fill in the blank: A streak length of 0 means one \_\_\_ which must occur after a 
miss that ended the preceeding streak.
<strong> Answer Question 2 to the left.</strong>
