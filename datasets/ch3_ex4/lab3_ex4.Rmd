## Compared to What?

We've shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough 
to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to?

To answer these questions, let's return to the idea of *independence*. Two 
processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn't effect the outcome 
of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, 
having made or missed your first shot will not affect the probability that you
will make or miss your second shot.

A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are *not* independent of one 
another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot hand model 
says he will have a *higher* probability of making his second shot.

Let's suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his
career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting 
percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation,

\[ P(\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \]

If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (*not* independent shots), then 
the probability that he makes his second shot would go up to, let's say, 60%,

\[ P(\textrm{shot 2 = H} \, | \, \textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.60 \]

As a result of these increased probabilites, you'd expect Kobe to have longer 
streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where Kobe does *not* have a
hot hand, where each shot is independent of the next. If he hit his first shot,
the probability that he makes the second is still 0.45.

\[ P(\textrm{shot 2 = H} \, | \, \textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \]

In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the probability that
he'd make his second shot. If Kobe's shots are independent, then he'd have the 
same probability of hitting every shot regardless of his past shots: 45%.

Now that we've phrased the situation in terms of independent shots, let's return
to the question: how do we tell if Kobe's shooting streaks are long enough to 
indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his streak lengths to someone
without hot hands: an independent shooter. 

## Simulations in R

While we don't have any data from a shooter we know to have independent shots, 
that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R. In a simulation, you set the 
ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to 
generate an outcome that adheres to those rules. As a simple example, you can
simulate flipping a fair coin with the following.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r head-tail}
coin_outcomes <- c("heads", "tails")
sample(coin_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```

The vector `outcomes` can be thought of as a hat with two slips of paper in it: 
one slip says `heads` and the other says `tails`. The function `sample` draws 
one slip from the hat and tells us if it was a head or a tail. 

Run the second command listed above several times. Just like when flipping a 
coin, sometimes you'll get a heads, sometimes you'll get a tails, but in the 
long run, you'd expect to get roughly equal numbers of each.

If you wanted to simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times, you could either run 
the function 100 times or, more simply, adjust the `size` argument, which 
governs how many samples to draw (the `replace = TRUE` argument indicates we put
the slip of paper back in the hat before drawing again). Save the resulting 
vector of heads and tails in a new object called `sim_fair_coin`.

```{r sim-fair-coin}
sim_fair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
```

To view the results of this simulation, type the name of the object and then use
`table` to count up the number of heads and tails.

```{r table-sim-fair-coin}
sim_fair_coin
table(sim_fair_coin)
```

Since there are only two elements in `outcomes`, the probability that we "flip" 
a coin and it lands heads is 0.5. Say we're trying to simulate an unfair coin 
that we know only lands heads 20% of the time. We can adjust for this by adding 
an argument called `prob`, which provides a vector of two probability weights.

```{r sim-unfair-coin}
sim_unfair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, 
                          prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
```

`prob = c(0.2, 0.8)` indicates that for the two elements in the `outcomes` vector,
we want to select the first one, `heads`, with probability 0.2 and the second 
one, `tails` with probability 0.8. Another way of thinking about this is to 
think of the outcome space as a bag of 10 chips, where 2 chips are labeled 
"head" and 8 chips "tail". Therefore at each draw, the probability of drawing a 
chip that says "head"" is 20%, and "tail" is 80%.

<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many flips came up heads?
</div>

In a sense, we've shrunken the size of the slip of paper that says "heads", 
making it less likely to be drawn and we've increased the size of the slip of 
paper saying "tails", making it more likely to be drawn. When we simulated the 
fair coin, both slips of paper were the same size. This happens by default if 
you don't provide a `prob` argument; all elements in the `outcomes` vector have 
an equal probability of being drawn.

If you want to learn more about `sample` or any other function, recall that you 
can always check out its help file with `?sample`.


## Simulating the Independent Shooter

Simulating a basketball player who has independent shots uses the same mechanism 
that we use to simulate a coin flip. To simulate a single shot from an 
independent shooter with a shooting percentage of 50% we type,

```{r sim-basket}
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```

To make a valid comparison between Kobe and our simulated independent shooter, 
we need to align both their shooting percentage and the number of attempted shots.


<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: What change needs to be made to the `sample` function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%? Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign the output of this simulation to a new object called `sim_basket`.
</div>
   
Note that we've named the new vector `sim_basket`, the same name that we gave to
the previous vector reflecting a shooting percentage of 50%. In this situation, 
R overwrites the old object with the new one, so always make sure that you don't
need the information in an old vector before reassigning its name.

With the results of the simulation saved as `sim_basket`, we have the data 
necessary to compare Kobe to our independent shooter.

Both data sets represent the results of 133 shot attempts, each with the same 
shooting percentage of 45%. We know that our simulated data is from a shooter 
that has independent shots. That is, we know the simulated shooter does not have
a hot hand.

### Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter

<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: Using `calc_streak`, compute the streak lengths of `sim_basket`, and save the results in a data frame called `sim_streak`. Note that since the `sim_streak` object is just a vector and not a variable in a data frame, we don't need to first select it from a data frame like we did earlier when we calculated the streak lengths for Kobe's shots.
</div>
```{r sim-streak-lengths}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit

```
   
<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: Make a plot of the distribution of simulated streak lengths of the independent shooter. What is the typical streak length for this simulated independent shooter with a 45% shooting percentage? How long is the player's longest streak of baskets in 133 shots?
</div>
```{r plot-sim-streaks}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit

```

4.  If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how 
would you expect its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the 
exercise above?
