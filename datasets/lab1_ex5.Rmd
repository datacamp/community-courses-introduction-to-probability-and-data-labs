Calculate the total number of births for each year and store these values in a new 
variable called `total` in the `present` dataset. 

In case you forgot, you can add variables to a dataset using the `$` operator. 
(i.e. `dataset$new_column <- dataset$column1 -+ dataset$column2`)

Then, calculate the proportion of boys born each year and store these values in a new variable called `prop_boys` in the same dataset. 

5. Plot these values over time and based on the plot determine if the following statement is true or false: The proportion of boys born in the US has decreased over time. 

You used the following code to plot the proportion of boy births over time for the `arbuthnot` dataset.
`ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = boys/total)) + geom_line() + geom_point()`

<ol>
<li> True </li>
<li> False </li>
</ol>

```{r prop-boys-over-time}
# type your code for Question 5 here, and Knit

```
