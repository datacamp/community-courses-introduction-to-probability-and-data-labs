6. Create a new variable called `more_boys` which contains the value of either `TRUE` 
if that year had more boys than girls, or `FALSE` if that year did not. Based on this 
variable which of the following statements is true? 

The code that created the `more_boys` column for the `arbuthnot` dataset used the following functions and operators: `%>%`, `mutate()`, `>`.

<ol>
<li> Every year there are more girls born than boys. </li>
<li> Every year there are more boys born than girls. </li>
<li> Half of the years there are more boys born, and the other half more girls born. </li>
</ol>

```{r more-boys-per-year}
