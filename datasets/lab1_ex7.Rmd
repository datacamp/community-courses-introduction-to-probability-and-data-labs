7. Calculate the boy-to-girl ratio each year, and store these values in a new variable called `prop_boy_girl` in the `present` dataset. Plot these values over time. Which of the following best describes the trend? 

In case you forgot, you can add variables to a dataset using the `$` operator. 
(i.e. `dataset$new_column <- dataset$column1 -+ dataset$column2`)

You used the following code to plot the proportion of boy births over time for the `arbuthnot` dataset.
`ggplot(data = arbuthnot, aes(x = year, y = boys/total)) + geom_line() + geom_point()`

**See Quesiton 7.

```{r prop-boy-girl-over-time}
# type your code for Question 7 here, use the output from this line to answer Question 7, and Knit

```
