10.  Suppose you define a flight to be "on time" if it gets to the destination on 
time or earlier than expected, regardless of any departure delays. Mutate the data 
frame to create a new variable called `arr_type` with levels `"on time"` and 
`"delayed"` based on this definition. Then, determine the on time arrival percentage 
based on whether the flight departed on time or not. What percent of flights  that 
were `"delayed"` departing arrive `"on time"`?
