2. Make a histogram and calculate appropriate summary statistics for **arrival** 
delays of `sfo_feb_flights`. Which of the following is false? 
<strong>Answer Question 2 to the left.</strong>


```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# The following code is from exercise 1 to create the sfo_feb_flights data frame
sfo_feb_flights <- nycflights %>%
  filter(dest == "SFO", month == 2)

```


```{r sfo-feb-flights-arrival-delays}
# type your code for Question 2 here, and Knit

```
