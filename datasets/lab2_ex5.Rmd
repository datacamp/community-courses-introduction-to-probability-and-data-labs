5.  Which month has the highest median departure delay from an NYC airport?
<strong>Answer Question 5 to the left.</strong>

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r highest-median-dep-delay-month}
# type your code for Question 5 here, and Knit

```
